I contributed to multiple different aspects of this project including the following: 

Assisted in debuging process within the init.py with problems saving session. The Issue was with associating session with profiles. As a group we ran into more issues connecting games and platforms with sessions as well in which I assisted in providing different solutions. This includes using resources such as StacksOverflow to come up with new approaches all within the init.py file. 

Along with this, I recorded and wrote script for the data model portion of project video. This includes describing the different attributes within each object and their relationships with each other. Such as the one to one relationships, many to one relationships, etc. 

In total I assisted with providing other solutions to the debugging process within our "py" files along with the rest of the group. Adding to that I made sure to make it to group meetings to collaborate with the group and assist in any coding issues that arised. Along with the debugging after the code was drafted by Yusef; I worked along with Panav and Navin to draft and record the audio/visuals of our video. In conclusion, this  was the first time I have worked with Django and Python. However, I did my best with coding and providing assistance to any parts of the project we had to complete.
