# Personal Writeup for Rudy Pikulik

Submission 2 was meant to deal with primarily URL Mapping and Django modeling, among other things. There were few pieces of this project that I did not work on during submission 2. The first thing I did in submission 2, which I later learned was not part of this submission, was authorization. I built basic login, logout, and signup flows for the website, which will come in handy later on.

Although there were many contributors and many iterations of the faker data, I also wrote a lot of the final faker code used in init.py, and made sure that this fit with our models. When setting up the faker data to fit into our views, I ended up creating more views that were missing from our project one submission. One large trouble I had was setting up URL mapping to the individual session pages, as it cannot be a static URL. This was fixed eventually.

Bug fixing was a large part of this submission, and that occurred everywhere in this project from the authentication, views, and faker mentioned above, to the  URLs, models, and nearly every other part of our project. I, like every member in our team, was a part of this process.
