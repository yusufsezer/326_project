Since project two, our project has grown immensely, and it is to the credit of every member of our team. Specifically, I worked a lot to change our project from statically generated faker content to a modifiable structure, such as allowing users to join and view groups they are not in and working on the chat feature. 

In addition to this, I worked to incorporate logged in user data to our website. Once our templates were changed to incorporate actual user data, a big issue we had was that all the pages would break if there was not a user logged in. This was fixed by detecting the authentication status of a visitor and direct them to sign up if they were not logged in. 

Everyone on our team worked on fixing and finding bugs throughout our website. The most notable of these problems, other than the authentication problem described above, included users not being able to view groups they wished to join, and problems where users could attempt to join groups more than once.
