# Team G: Rudy On Rails
### Personal Write Up by Panav Setia
### Write Up for Part 3

One contribution I made to this part of the project was debugging our web app. For example I realized that moderator (a user in a special user group with extra permissions was not able to see messages in groups the moderator was not a part of. Later I helped implement changes in the code to fix the error.

Another contribution I made to this project was writing the basic layout for the scripts for the video, editting the video, and Uploading it to YouTube. I also helped teammates who were struggling with some code and helped them debug their code.

Lastly, I worked on created a more pleasant UI for the login page. I attempted to add a background picture and create a transperant login div with dummy values in the username and password feild.. Unfortunately this part has been pushed to the next submission because it was not essential for this part of the project.
