For this part of the submission, I helped fix some of the UI aspects of the website making some plain and bad looking pages look better. For example, the signup page was changed and I also inserted our logo where it was appropriate. Other coding parts of this submission mainly included helping debugging the views file and other UI changes.

I also worked on the team writeup. I helped organized and write the team writeup that is being submitted by writing the overview, outling the use case of our project and by writing about the design overview of the project.

I also helped create the video for this project by helping write the script for our recording and by being a part of the video. I helped record the script and walkthrough of our new changes to the website.
