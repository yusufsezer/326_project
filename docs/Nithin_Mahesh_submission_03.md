# Team G: Team RudyOnRails

# Personal Writeup: Nithin Mahesh

I contributed to multiple different aspects of this project including the following: 

I documented the process and steps required to incorporating user authentication. This was all part of the team write up, in which I wrote about the design overview and some of the steps we went through with creating the Django token authentication. As well as the problems and sucesses so far in this portion of the project.

Moving on to the final touches of the project once our code was running and pushed to github I aided in writing a script for the project video demonstration along with Navin and Panav. We then divided the script into seperate sections to record each divided between us. I specifically recorded the section on the moderator and how they are allowed permission to certain features of our application. 

In total, I contributed most to the team write up and video making portions of the project. Adding to that I made sure to make it to all group meetings to collaborate with the group and add to what we had previously.
