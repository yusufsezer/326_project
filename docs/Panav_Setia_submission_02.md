# Team G: Rudy On Rails
### Personal Write Up by Panav Setia


One contribution I made was helping to implement the base generic template in all of our html pages. This involved learning the syntax of the block structures provided by django. It also involved learning about the static feature and implementing it.

Another contribution I made was writing the scripts for the video, editting the video, and uploading it to YouTube. I also helped in recording the segments of our video. I also worked on the initial data model and deciding the relationships between attributes (if they were many to many, 1 to many, 0 to many, etc).

Lasty, I worked on many aspects of the debugging. There were bugs in the url mapping and I made an insight to change the way path was being called. While working on implementing fake data using faker, we came across the error that the ManyToMany file descriptor was not iterable and I worked a long time on trying to fix the bug. I also helped other people with github issues and fixing some merge conflicts.
