For this project, I worked heavily on implementing functionality for multiple forms on the site. Namely, I made the following forms functional (i.e. interacting with the forms modifies/accesses the app's data model):

* "post session" form
* "chat" form
* "find a group" form.

I also modified the site so that certain HTML elements only display for users in the "moderator" user group (these users have more permissions than normal users). Specifically, I made it possible for "moderator" users to view/delete messages in ANY session (including those they are not a part of).

In addition to these contributions, I contributed miscellaneous bug-fixes and helped to coordinate different tasks with the team.
