# Team G: Rudy on Rails

## Christopher Rybicki

During this submission cycle, I contributed to several aspects of the project. Firstly, during our in-class working sessions, I helped with debugging several problems with various pages crashing due to faulty links or views not being created assigned properly.

In addition, I assisted with deciding how certain aspects of the application (such as groups) should be implemented with respect to user permissions, leading to the creation of a moderator role. Once we accomplished this, I was able to begin implement creation of the group using the faker library which my teammates later built off of.

Lastly, I cleaned up several parts of the user interface (using CSS) in preparation for the final project submission. I also created an "about us" page that informs users about our team, even taking the effort to photoshop-in a team member that wasn't included in the photo.
