# Team G: Rudy on Rails

## Christopher Rybicki

I contributed to several aspects of this project. Initially, I spent a significant amount of time in class organizing the data model for our project, including making the executive decision of using Lucid Charts so we could all edit the data model at the same time. This increased productivity for many of the group members.

In our group's meetings outside of class, I also built off of a team member's initial draft of a "base" template for our HTML pages, and I integrated it into all of the other core HTML pages our team had written from the Submission 1 project. I also fixed issues with static files not working across all files, and a minor bug where Bootstrap styling for the navigation bar was causing the website to display the menu always opened on mobile layouts.

After this was complete, I worked on integrating components from the data model with (which fake data was generated for) into the HTML pages, using the Django templates. Lastly, at the end of our group's last meeting during crunch time, I was able to solve a bug that our team had for over half an hour that was holding us from shooting our final video.
