# Innovative Idea

PlayWithMe provides a platform for gamers to find and game with each other, locally and online. The platform will allow users to create and post “sessions” for other users to find and join. Each session will have various attributes associated with it, such as number of participants, game(s), platform, local vs. online etc. When a user wants to game with others, they can simply use the application’s search function to find sessions that best match their ideal gaming experience.
For example, a user may post a local session for others who want to play Halo. Other users can search for this session via filtering criteria in the search function (such as geographic distance) or by entering the session’s unique ID. Once a user finds the session, they can communicate with the session host via the built in chat function. If the user wants to participate in the session, they can request to join the session. Upon approval, the session will reflect that the user is now part of the session.
Although our idea revolves around gaming--similar to platforms like Twitch--it does not revolve around streaming. Rather, our application is focused on providing a way for gamers to find a group to play with, both locally and online.

# Important Data

The platform is based off of users creating gaming sessions that others can join. Other than account information, we will have to manage each proposed gaming session including it’s location, game type, game platform, and other important traits. There will also be the ability to communicate with people once a session has been formed. 
	Sessions contain a lot of different types of data as noted above. The most important type of data is the identity of who is joining the session, which is represented as an account. All sessions will be backed with a unique ID, that allows us to keep track of them. It will most likely be represented as a 7 character code. A third type of data is geographical data, which is important to match up gamers who are looking for an in person gaming session. Another type of data is temporal data, which will define when a session is to take place, when a session was created, and when users joined it. Once a session is filled, the members will be able to communicate in real time through messaging. Finally, we hope to add the ability to connect accounts from other platforms such as Xbox Live, which could include a lot of different types of data.
