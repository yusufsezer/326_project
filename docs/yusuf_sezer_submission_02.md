# Team G: Rudy On Rails
### Personal Write Up - Yusuf Sezer

For this project, I personally implemented the data models in the models.py module. Furthermore, I registered all of the models in the admin.py module so that we could create/view data via the Django admin site. Then, in the init.py module, I implemented programmatic generation of fake data via the Faker library and programmatically registered an admin user.

In addition to implementing the models, registering them with the admin site, and configuring fake data generation, I also modified some of the team's HTML pages so that they would be correctly populated with the generated data from our data model. Specifically, I did this for the post_session_page.html and search.html files.

In addition to my specific contributions, I also helped the team with general bug fixes across the Django data model implementation as well as the template/views implementation. Finally, I helped the team coordinate code changes and properly utilize git.
