One contribution that I made to this part of the project was creating the url mappings between different url paths and the corresponding html pages. This included writing out the different url paths and connecting them with a view of each corresponding html file.

One other part that I worked on was linking our Messages to our Sessions such that in the admin site, we can see the messages under a session and also see the session associated with a message. This required me to find a way to access a the sessions correlated to different messages, and select a random session for each message. This work was done in the init.py file to set up the faker data.

Lastly, I was also involved in debugging the problems we had with connecting all the session data with other data, such as users, in our init.py file. This was a bug we ran into because of the differet datatypes that our data was being represented with. We needed to find a way to extract the needed information. Specifically, we needed to select a user whose session belonged to a different list of session which was made difficult by the datatypes that stored the list of sessions. I was also involved in the making of the group video such writing the script and recording sections of the video.
